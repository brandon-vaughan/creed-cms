# Remnant

The firm’s current project is a major motion picture screenplay entitled “War: The Remnant,” an original epic (and part 1 in a series) designed and built to captivate audiences with a story unlike any seen or told before.

**Tag Line:** Begin a journey through war, hell, and death … to the meaning of life.

**Genre:** War/Romance/Historical Fiction/Based on Ancient Text

**Log Line:** Before the primeval flood, as the world descends deep into wickedness, a brilliant but broken warrior prince—guardian of an ancient and mysterious blessing—must overcome a crushing invasion and somehow outfox and outfight the enemy’s unnervingly lethal warlord, a man seemingly destined to annihilate him, his kingdom, the blessing, and the future it holds for mankind.

**Pitch:** "Lord of the Rings" meets “Ben-Hur” meets “Braveheart” meets "300"
